Passwords are, by default, chosen from the union of three character classes: upper-case letters, lower-case letters, and digits. Options can be given to omit any one or any two of these character classes. For instance, you can omit uppercase letters and digits by passing -upper=false -digit=false to linenoise-classic . This will return a password composed only of lowercase letters. Passwords are guaranteed to contain at least one of each selected character class. The default length is 16. linenoise-classic will create a password of any length greater than or equal to the number of character classes selected. If the password length is less than or equal to the total number of characters selected, linenoise-classic will not repeat characters within the generated password.","title":"Home"},{"location":"contributing/","text":"Contributing Bug reports and pull requests are welcome on GitHub at https://github.com/markcornick/linenoise-classic.
